This programming assignment involves building a social media simulation by implementing a hash table with linear probing for user management and a directed graph for follow relationships. The system will support user interactions such as adding, following, and unfollowing, while efficiently handling collisions and load factor management. Additionally, the assignment requires Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to simulate information diffusion across the network. A key aspect of the project is generating an adjacency matrix representation of the social network and computing various traversal metrics. Exception handling is also incorporated for robust error management.
