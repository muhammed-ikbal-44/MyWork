This programming assignment involves implementing a self-balancing binary search tree using the Day–Stout–Warren (DSW) algorithm. Students will develop a DSWTree class that efficiently maintains balance, ensuring optimized search, insertion, and deletion operations. The tree structure will be extended into a TreeMap, allowing for efficient key-value storage and retrieval. Finally, the TreeMap will be applied to build an inverted index, enabling fast and efficient text retrieval. Proper tree balancing, efficient data structures, and optimized search functionalities are critical for this assignment.
