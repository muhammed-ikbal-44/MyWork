This programming assignment involves implementing a hospital simulation system using Discrete Event Simulation (DES). The system requires developing two linked list-based data structures: FCFSList (a singly linked queue) and SortedList (a doubly linked sorted list). These structures will manage patients, events, and doctors while efficiently processing events in the simulation. Students will implement priority-based patient handling, dynamic memory management, and event-driven processing in C++ without STL. Proper linked list operations and memory management are critical for successful implementation.
