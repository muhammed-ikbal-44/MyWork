PDF explains the task and the algorithm of the code clearly.

This take-home exam requires implementing a Python function, check_month(month_calendar), that verifies the validity of a babysitting schedule according to predefined rules for different caretakers. The function ensures that all constraints, such as availability, restrictions, and additional costs, are met while considering weekends as part of consecutive day calculations. If the schedule is valid, the function returns the total babysitting cost for the month; otherwise, it returns a list of breached rule numbers. The implementation must avoid loops, relying instead on list comprehensions and higher-order functions for evaluation.
