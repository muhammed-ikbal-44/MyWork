This take-home exam requires implementing a function area(Q, T) that calculates the overlapping area between a convex quadrilateral and a triangle in a 2D plane. The function must determine the exact region of intersection and return its area as a real number. Given integer coordinates for both shapes, the task involves computational geometry techniques such as polygon clipping and area computation. The function must handle complex intersection cases while ensuring precise calculations.
