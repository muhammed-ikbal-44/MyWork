PDF explains clearly the task of work.

This take-home exam requires implementing functions to determine various family relationships within a partial family tree represented as a nested list. The tree structure includes only one parent per child and distinguishes genders based on name capitalization. Functions will be developed to find brothers, sisters, siblings, uncles, aunts, and cousins of a given person by recursively traversing the tree structure. The solution must conform to strict formatting rules, handle hierarchical relationships efficiently, and avoid external module imports.
