This take-home exam focuses on implementing a dynamic 2D array structure to store and manage name codes efficiently. Students will develop a system that transforms names into unique numerical codes, assigns them to dynamically allocated arrays, and handles storage expansions when necessary. Key operations include inserting name codes, managing dynamic memory, and optimizing storage performance. Proper implementation of memory management and data structures is essential for success in this assignment.
