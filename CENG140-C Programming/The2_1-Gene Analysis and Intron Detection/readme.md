This take-home exam focuses on analyzing DNA sequences to identify intron positions. Given a gene sequence containing three exons and two introns, students will extract the exon regions, transcribe them into mRNA, and determine if the resulting protein sequence matches the provided input. If a match is found, the intron start and end positions must be reported. The implementation should efficiently process large DNA sequences while adhering to given constraints.
